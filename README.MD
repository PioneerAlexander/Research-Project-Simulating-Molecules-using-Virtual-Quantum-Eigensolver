# Research Project "Simulating Molecules using Virtual Quantum Solver"

The project is devoted to molecular modeling, a widely used and rapidly developing field of science.
This field requires a high level of knowledge in quantum physics and quantum chemistry,
the understanding of which is certainly not without mathematics, and the successful implementation of the methods
requires computation on quantum computers.

By modeling molecules, we can greatly increase productivity of programs related to computing characteristics for
molecules, take into account all their peculiarities. Many problems of quantum mechanics are reduced to solving SLAEs or
searching for eigenvalues, as in the problem I am considering.

The main task of my project is to get acquainted with such a tool as quantum computing and how it helps to solve a
certain applied problem, which undoubtedly also needs to be dealt with.

Full description of my research you can find [here](sources/ENGsemesterProject.pdf) in the English language, and
[here](sources/RUsemesterProject.pdf) in the Russian language.

There is also [python code](src/semester_project.ipynb) I used to search energy for molecules _LiH_ and _H_2_. That code
was written at the end of 2022 during the third semester, and as I mentioned in my presentation, python libraries for
quantum computing are constantly changing. Unfortunately, one of the cells throws Assertion Error because one of the
classes no longer contains the method used in this cell. However, the result of searching energies you can find at the
end of my presentation.
